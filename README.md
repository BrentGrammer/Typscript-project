## Typescript Project

- Following Stephen Grider's Udemy course
- Demonstration of Typescript basics such as Interfaces, Classes, Type Annotations and Design Patterns

### General conventions followed:
- Use of type inference for variables that are assigned on one line, but always use type annotations for functions or variable declaration without assignment.
- Named Exports for all source code written by the developer (avoids confusion on when to use curly braces or not for importing code).
- Use of type definition files for third party libraries

## Building with Parcel:
